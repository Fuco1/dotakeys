note:
The 1.4 version is (will be) COMPLETE REMAKE of DotaKeys. I have lot of ideas from the 
past 2 years, from my head and from yours, and i still have new (and you too) and the
old core has been just too unstable and bad coded to do some "major upgrading" Now i try 
to code in the way i can change it easier in future (which was not my intention when i 
firstly published it :D I expected maybe 500 users, not 55000 @_@)

Thanx to all of you who still support this project and use it (and i hope like it)

note2:
Counting system is changed (again), because this is not stable and final release of 1.4.
The new versions starts from 0.0.0
When 1.4 will be out, ill come back to old system so 1.4.0 => 1.4.1 etc... :) now i make lot of 
versions for betatesters, and i need it for better debugging and stuff ... (i have versions like
1.4-0.1.5r165 ~~) But remember its still 1.4 so its better then 1.32 :D

note3:
I decided to distribute DK along with all the sourcecodes of actual release, you can find link to download
in this file or just check .ahk files in your dotakeys installation folder.
